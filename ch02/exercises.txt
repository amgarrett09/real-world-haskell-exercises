List and tuple exercises:

1.
  False is of type Bool
  (["foo", "bar"], 'a') is of type ([[Char]], Char) (e.g., a 2-tuple of a
    list of Strings and a Char)
  [(True, []), (False, [['a']])] is of type
    [(Bool, [[Char]])]


Polymorphism exercises:

1. The function last, which is of type [a] -> a, can *only* return the last
element of a list. It can't produce a value of type a, and it can't turn an a
into any other type, because it doesn't have information about what concrete
type the value is.

2. Solution is in the lastButOne.hs file in the current directory.

3. If the list is too short, lastButOne will throw an exception.
