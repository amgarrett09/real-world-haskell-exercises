# Chapter 2 - Types and Functions

The chapter can be found by [clicking
here](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/types-and-functions.html).

I have some notes on recursion in the file
[myDrop.hs](https://github.com/amgarrett09/real-world-haskell-exercises/blob/master/ch02/myDrop.hs).

As usual, exercise solutions are in the
[exercises.txt](https://github.com/amgarrett09/real-world-haskell-exercises/blob/master/ch02/exercises.txt) file.
